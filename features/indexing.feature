Scenario: Save xapian database on index
  Given no file exists at "tmp/xapiandb"
  And I configured the database to be saved at "tmp/xapiandb"
  And 3 records
  When I index the database
  Then I should find a directory at "tmp/xapiandb"

Scenario: Fetch all records which are indexed
  Given an empty database at "tmp/xapiandb"
  And records named "John, Jane, Joe"
  When I index the database
  And I query for ""
  Then I should find records named "John, Jane, Joe"
